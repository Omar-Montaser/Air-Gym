## Architecture

The application is structured using the MVC pattern:

- **Model**: Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) representing entities such as `Member`, `Trainer`, `Session`, etc.
- **View**: FXML files defining the UI layout, paired with corresponding controllers handling user interactions.
- **Controller**: The main controller orchestrates interactions between the DAO layer, FXML views, and their controllers.

The DAO layer handles all database interactions using JDBC, executing SQL scripts, stored procedures, and functions to perform CRUD operations.

## Database Schema

The backend is powered by Microsoft SQL Server. The database schema includes tables for:

- Users
- Member
- Trainer
- Branch
- Equipment
- MembershipType
- Session
- Booking
- Payment

SQL scripts are provided to create the necessary tables, stored procedures, and functions that facilitate the application's operations.
